# [Tall Green Tree Website](http://tallgreentree.github.com)

This is the website for Tall Green Tree. It makes sense to me to have it as the [organization page](http://tallgreentree.github.com) on github

### Setting up the site

We're loading a fair amount of random scss files because it's easy.

If you want to build the stylesheet, run sass at the root of this directory:
    
    sass --style compressed --watch assets/styles/global.scss:site.css
